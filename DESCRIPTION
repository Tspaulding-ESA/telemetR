Description: A package for analyzing telemetry datasets generalized to allow
    any tecnology. The filtering steps check for false positives caused by 
    reflected transmissions from surfaces and false pings from other noise 
    generating equipment. The filters are based on JSATS filtering algorithms
    found in package `filteRjsats` but have been generalized to allow the user
    to define many of the filtering variables. Additionally, this package
    contains scripts used to help identify an optimal maximum blanking period as
    defined in Capello et al. 2015. The functions were written attempting to 
    duplicate their efforts, but have not been reviewed by the authors for
    accuracy. It is included here as is, without warranty. Citation:
